# PokéLab

An MCP server that fetches, saves, designs, and renders Pokemon cards inside Claude Desktop or VS Code Copilot Chat.

Built for EAGv3 Session 4 and expanded as a Prefab UI showcase.

---

## What it does

Six tools, exposed over the Model Context Protocol:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fetch_real_card(name)` | Looks up a real Pokemon card by name from the [Pokemon TCG API](https://docs.pokemontcg.io/) |
| `manage_collection(action, …)` | CRUD over a personal card collection persisted to JSON |
| `refresh_collection_images()` | Backfills artwork URLs for saved cards that are missing them |
| `card_lab()` | Renders the saved collection as an interactive Prefab UI inside the chat |
| `design_card()` | Opens an interactive Prefab card studio with tabs, controls, metrics, a table, and a live preview |
| `save_custom_card(...)` | Saves the card submitted from the Prefab designer UI |

A slash command (`/design_card_walkthrough`) is also exposed, which kicks off a full demo end-to-end.

---

## Quick demo

In Claude Desktop with the server connected, type:

> *"Fetch a Pikachu and a Charizard, save them to my collection, then show me my collection in a Prefab dashboard. Then open the custom card designer."*

Claude or Copilot will fan out across the tools. A live, interactive Prefab dashboard renders inline in the chat when the host supports MCP Apps.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or if you use `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add `POKEMON_TCG_API_KEY` if you want higher Pokemon TCG API rate limits. The custom card designer works without any external LLM key.

### 3. Sanity check with the FastMCP inspector

Before wiring it into Claude Desktop, verify everything works in isolation:

```bash
cd pokelab
fastmcp dev inspector server.py
```

This opens the current FastMCP browser inspector. Click each tool, fill in the arguments, and watch the responses come back. For `card_lab` and `design_card`, the Prefab UI renders right there in the inspector — that's the same UI Claude Desktop will show you in chat.

If you want the dedicated app preview UI instead, run:

```bash
cd pokelab
fastmcp dev apps server.py
```

If port `8000` is already in use on your machine, pick another pair of ports, for example:

```bash
fastmcp dev apps server.py --mcp-port 8001 --dev-port 8081
```

A good test sequence in the inspector:

1. `fetch_real_card` → name: `pikachu` → see the card JSON
2. `manage_collection` → action: `add`, card: (paste the result above) → "Saved Pikachu..."
3. `card_lab` → click *Run* → a Prefab card renders below
4. `design_card` → click *Run* → the Prefab card studio opens

If those work, you're good. The MCP wire works, your Prefab installation works, and your file CRUD works.

## Connecting to Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop reads MCP server config from one JSON file. You'll add an entry pointing it at your `server.py`.

### 1. Find your Claude Desktop config file

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| **Linux** | `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |

If the file doesn't exist yet, create it.

### 2. Add the PokéLab entry

Edit the file to look like this. Replace the path with the **absolute** path to your `server.py`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pokelab": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:\\Users\\Akshay\\Repos\\EAGv3\\Session 4\\pokelab\\server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you already have other MCP servers configured, just add the `"pokelab"` block alongside them inside `mcpServers`.

**Path notes:**
- On Windows, use double backslashes (`\\`) in the path, OR forward slashes (`/`) — both work in JSON.
- On macOS/Linux, use a normal forward-slash path.
- If `python` isn't on your PATH, use the full path to your interpreter (e.g. `"C:\\Python312\\python.exe"` or `/usr/bin/python3`).
- If you used `uv`, you can replace `"command": "python"` with `"command": "uv"` and `"args": ["run", "python", "<path>/server.py"]`.

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

Quit completely (not just close the window) and reopen. Claude Desktop only re-reads the config on startup.

### 4. Verify the connection

Inside Claude Desktop, look for a small hammer/plug icon near the message input — that's the MCP indicator. Click it and you should see "pokelab" listed with the PokéLab tools (`fetch_real_card`, `manage_collection`, `refresh_collection_images`, `card_lab`, `design_card`, `save_custom_card`) and the prompt (`design_card_walkthrough`).

If the server fails to start, click the indicator to see the error message. The most common causes are:

- **Wrong path** in the JSON — copy-paste the path from your file explorer to be sure.
- **Wrong `python` command** — try the full path to the interpreter that has the dependencies installed.
- **Missing dependencies** — open a terminal and run `python <path>/server.py` directly. If it errors out about a missing module, fix that first.

## Connecting to VS Code Copilot Chat

VS Code supports MCP servers through `mcp.json`, and current builds also support MCP Apps rendered inline in chat when the server returns an app-enabled tool result.

### Option 1 — workspace config

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in this workspace and add:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "pokelab": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "C:/Users/Akshay/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python314/python.exe",
      "args": ["C:/Users/Akshay/Repos/pokelab/server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you want a more portable config, replace the absolute paths with the Python command and `${workspaceFolder}` path that match your machine.

### Option 2 — command palette

Run **MCP: Add Server** from the Command Palette, choose a local stdio server, use the Python executable as the command, and pass `C:/Users/Akshay/Repos/pokelab/server.py` as the argument. Choose Workspace if you want the config stored in `.vscode/mcp.json`, or Global/User if you want it available everywhere.

After adding it, run **MCP: List Servers**, start `pokelab`, trust the server when prompted, then open Copilot Chat and use Agent mode. The tools, prompt, resources, and MCP Apps can be enabled or disabled from the chat tool picker.

---

## Using it in chat

Once the server shows up in Claude Desktop, you can interact with it in plain English.

### Example 1 — single-tool call

> *"Use PokéLab to fetch the Charizard card and tell me its attacks."*

Claude calls `fetch_real_card("charizard")`, parses the result, and answers in prose.

### Example 2 — multi-tool fan-out

> *"Fetch Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Squirtle. Save all three to my collection, then show me the collection."*

Claude calls `fetch_real_card` three times, `manage_collection` three times, and finally `card_lab` once. The Prefab dashboard renders inline showing all three cards.

### Example 3 — the card studio

> *"Open the PokéLab custom card designer."*

Copilot calls `design_card()`. A Prefab app opens with tabs, select menus, radio buttons, sliders, switches, checkboxes, text areas, an accordion, metrics, progress, a table, and a live card preview. The Save button calls `save_custom_card(...)` behind the scenes.

### Example 4 — the slash command

In Claude Desktop's input, type `/` and you should see `design_card_walkthrough` in the prompt menu. Selecting it auto-fills the multi-tool demo prompt.

## How it works

The architecture in one picture:

```
Claude/Copilot ──MCP/stdio──►  server.py  ──HTTP──►  Pokemon TCG API
           │
                                    ▼
                             sandbox/collection.json
```

Three layers:

1. **The MCP client** picks tools based on what you ask for.
2. **PokéLab server (`server.py`)** runs Python functions decorated with `@mcp.tool()` (or `@mcp.tool(app=True)` for the UI tools). It calls the Pokemon TCG API, persists to a JSON file, and returns either dicts/strings or Prefab UI trees.
3. **The data plane** — JSON file for persistence and the Pokemon TCG API for real-card content.

### The seam between MCP and Prefab

The single most important line in the codebase:

```python
@mcp.tool(app=True)
def card_lab() -> PrefabApp:
    ...
```

The `app=True` flag changes the meaning of the return value. Without it, an MCP tool returns text. With it, the tool returns a *rendered, interactive Prefab page* that Claude Desktop displays inline.

That one flag is what makes Pokemon cards render inside the chat instead of being described in prose.

### Why `design_card` works without prompt engineering

The trick is that the user fills a structured Prefab UI instead of writing a long prompt. The app keeps state for card fields, previews the card live, and sends the fields to `save_custom_card(...)`. Python takes that structured spec and saves it through the same collection pipeline used for real cards.

```
Prefab form controls
            │
            ▼
  save_custom_card(...)
  { name, hp, types, attacks, ... }
            │
            ▼
   _render_card(spec)
   → builds Prefab tree
            │
            ▼
  Claude Desktop or VS Code renders it inline
```

This makes the project a better Prefab showcase: the card studio uses tabs, cards, inputs, selects, radio buttons, sliders, switches, checkboxes, accordions, badges, metrics, progress, tables, buttons, actions, and state templates.

## File structure

```
pokelab/
├── server.py            # tools, prompt, save helper, and Prefab renderers
├── sandbox/
│   └── collection.json  # the saved card collection
├── requirements.txt
├── .env.example
├── .env                 # your real keys (gitignored)
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

One Python file. That's deliberate — it mirrors `example_mcp_server.py` from Lesson 01 so you can read it top to bottom.

---

## Mapping back to the lessons

If you trace the code in `server.py`, every section corresponds to a Session 4 lesson:

| Code section | Came from |
|---|---|
| `from fastmcp import FastMCP`, `mcp.run()` | Lesson 02 |
| HTTP fetch helper, sandbox folder | Lesson 01 |
| `_load_collection`/`_save_collection` (JSON) | Lesson 01 (`note_*` family, simplified) |
| `@mcp.tool(app=True)` returning `PrefabApp` | Lesson 04C |
| `with Card(): with CardHeader(): ...` DSL | Lesson 04A |
| `Badge`, `Muted`, `Row`, `Column`, `Tab`, `Slider`, `Switch`, `Table` | Lesson 04D's widget catalog |
| `CallTool`, `ShowToast`, `PrefabApp(state={...})` | Lesson 04B/04C reactive UI patterns |
| `@mcp.prompt()` slash command | Lesson 01 (`review_code` / `debug_error`) |

The interesting thing is the *combination*.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No module named fastmcp" / prefab_ui

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have multiple Python installations, make sure you're installing into the same one your MCP client is using.

### `card_lab` shows an empty collection

You haven't saved any cards yet. Call `fetch_real_card` first, then `manage_collection("add", card=...)`, then `card_lab`. The dashboard reads from `sandbox/collection.json` — you can also open that file in a text editor to confirm what's there.

### `design_card` opens, but Save does not persist the card

Run the server through an MCP client that supports tool calls from Prefab actions. The Save button calls `save_custom_card(...)`, so the app host must support MCP Apps tool actions.

### Pokemon TCG API rate-limited (HTTP 429)

You're hitting the API too often without an API key. Add `POKEMON_TCG_API_KEY` to your `.env` (free at [dev.pokemontcg.io](https://dev.pokemontcg.io/)) — that bumps the limit from 30/min to 1000/min.

### The server starts but the MCP client doesn't see it

- **Did you fully quit and relaunch Claude Desktop?** Just closing the window doesn't reload the config.
- **Is the path absolute?** Relative paths don't work in the config file.
- **Does `python server.py` work from your terminal?** If not, fix that first — the MCP client runs the same command.

---

## What's deliberately not in here

The MCP spec includes a few advanced primitives — Sampling (server asks the host's LLM), Elicitation (server asks the user mid-tool), and the `GenerativeUI` provider (LLM literally writes Prefab Python in a sandbox). FastMCP supports all of these. None of them were in the Session 4 lessons, so none of them are in this project.

The patterns in `server.py` add up to a single Python file where one tool call fetches data, another saves it, another renders the collection as a UI, and another opens a Prefab designer that saves structured custom cards.
